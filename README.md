This is a command-line Battleship game where a player competes against a bot opponent. The game includes three difficulty levels, special abilities like radar and smoke screens, and victory conditions when all enemy ships are sunk.

### 1. **Features Section**:
- **What it needs**: A section explaining the key features and functionality of the game.
- **Recommendation**: List out what the game supports, like the difficulty levels and the bot's features.

**Example**:
Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose from easy, medium, or hard AI difficulty.
Radar Sweep: The AI can scan areas of the grid to find enemy ships.
Smoke Screen: The player can deploy smoke screens to hide ships from the AI.
Artillery and Torpedo Attacks: Special attacks that the AI can use at higher difficulties.
Console-based Gameplay: Simple grid-based visual interface to track shots and hits.

### 2. **Gameplay Instructions**:
- **What it needs**: There should be clear instructions for the user about how to play the game, which keys they need to press, and how the gameplay works.
- **Recommendation**: Add a section explaining the game’s controls and how to interact with the bot.

**Example**:
Start the game: Choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) when prompted.
Take turns: Players alternate turns with the AI to attack each other's ships.
Gameplay grid: Each player has a 10x10 grid to place ships and track shots.
Shooting: Type the coordinates (e.g., A5) to target a spot on the opponent’s grid.
Victory: The first player to sink all the opponent’s ships wins the game.

### 3. **Bot Behavior Explanation**:
- **What it needs**: You should explain how the AI behaves and how it changes based on the difficulty level, so users know what to expect.
- **Recommendation**: Add a section describing the bot's behavior at different difficulty levels.

**Example**:
Easy Difficulty: The bot randomly chooses a spot on the grid to attack.
Medium Difficulty: The bot will attempt to target previously hit locations and may deploy radar sweeps to find ships.
Hard Difficulty: The bot uses advanced strategies like artillery attacks, torpedoes, and smart radar sweeps to track down and sink ships.
